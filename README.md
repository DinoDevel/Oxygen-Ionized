# Oxygen-Ionized
Greenish KDE icon theme to match OpenSUSE and also any other distro, customized to look fresh and inspiring.

It is based on Oxygen 4.6.2 - the last version featured old-syle folder icons.

Why is it called "Oxygen Ionized"? Doubly ionized oxygen (also known as [O III]) is a forbidden line of the ion O2+. It is significant in that it emits light in the green part of the spectrum.

For OpenSUSE users it's now also available at Open Build Service for 1-click install: https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3AD_E&package=oxygen-ionized
